            <main>I am a Responsive Designer & Developer who thrives on visual storytelling. When I'm not working, pursuing side projects or getting lost in the rabbit hole of blogs & books, I can be found reading, cross-stitching and searching for new stories.</main>
            <div id="div-1" class="flex-items">
                I was born and raised in Upstate New York, but have lived in Northampton, PA for about the last 15 years. I am the oldest of six children, which has made me patient, which helps with problem-solving and debugging code, which is always a part of creating code. I love creating a website that encapsulates a companies ideals in one picture.

                  After a career of 25 years in Customer Service, I know how to please a customer. After leaving work due to a disability, I am now in a position to work again. Oddly, my disability makes me a better employee. Having to overcome major obstacles has made me appreciate my employment even more than others.

            <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
                  Coding is my Passion. It is seeing the big picture, & about dividing a big problem into small sub-problems or tasks & solving them one by one & it has opened new worlds for me, and hopefully I will be able to get a great paying job using my new skills.
